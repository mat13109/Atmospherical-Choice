# Atmospherical-Choice
Recently, I've been doing some experimental research in game development where I study things from the game industry and understand the technical process behind.  

So I was able to give a try at recreating the Mario Odyssey's Kingdom Select Screen on Unity!  

I tried to get at best the "To The Next World" feel from the original game on the Nintendo Switch.
