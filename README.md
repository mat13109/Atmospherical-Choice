# Atmospherical-Choice
Recently, I've been doing some experimental research in game development where I study things from the game industry and understand the technical process behind.  

So I was able to give a try at recreating the Mario Odyssey's Kingdom Select Screen on Unity!  

I tried to get at best the "To The Next World" feel from the original game on the Nintendo Switch.

## Inspiration
This project has been inspired by the first [video](https://youtu.be/sCK4u5ol3xw) of the YouTube channel [Mix and Jam](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLyVUwlB_Hahir_VsKkGPIA). It is an experimental game development channel, where they study things from the game industry and try their best to study and even recreate them!
